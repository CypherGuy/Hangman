# Hangman
A smaller, more compact version of the classic Hangman located at this link: https://github.com/jasmin-30/Hangman/blob/master/Hangman%20Game/Hangman.py

All content in this repo, except this readme file, is free to use. I will not sue you if you copy this and use it where you wish. Enjoy!

Note: All the words you want your hangman to pick from MUST be in the file called 'words.txt'. The code will not work if you rename it or put the words in a different file unless you edit line 10 in the function 'chooseword' to your file name.
